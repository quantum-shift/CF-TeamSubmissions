# CF-TeamSubmissions

This is a chrome extension for codeforces users preparing for team competitions.

**What does it do?**

This is useful if you are solving problems from codeforces.com/problemset.
You can add the handles of your team members, and all the problems solved by atleast one of them will be colored when you are browsing codeforces.com/problemset. 
This way you can collectively solve mutually exclusive sets of problems to maximise the number of different problems solved.

**Installation**

The extension is in an early stage and has not been published to the webstore. You can clone the repo and add the extension as shown in this picture:
